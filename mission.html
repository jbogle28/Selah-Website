            <h1>🌿 Our Mission at Selah Therapeutic Services Limited</h1>
            <p>Our mission is to create a safe, compassionate, and accessible space for individuals seeking emotional healing and personal growth. We are committed to offering high-quality psychological care that honors the dignity, individuality, and lived experience of every person who walks through our door.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission Principles</h2>
            
            <div class="principle">
                <h3>1. To Provide Compassionate, Evidence-Based Care</h3>
                <p>The aim is to deliver psychological services rooted in scientific research while acknowledging the complexity of human experience. Every intervention is chosen thoughtfully to promote wellness, clarity, and sustainable change.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle">
                <h3>2. To Empower Personal Healing and Growth</h3>
                <p>Individuals are inherently resilient. My role is to guide, support, and empower clients to navigate life's challenges, re-connect with their strengths, and move toward healthier patterns.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle">
                <h3>3. To Foster Safety, Respect, and Confidentiality</h3>
                <p>Healing happens when individuals feel protected, valued, and heard[cite: 23]. [cite_start]I uphold the highest ethical standards to create a secure environment where individuals can explore his or her inner world freely and without judgment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle">
                <h3>4. To Honor Mind, Body, and Spirit</h3>
                <p>We recognize that well-being is holistic. Individuals may choose purely psychological methods or opt for spiritually integrative support if aligned with their values and beliefs.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle">
                <h3>5. To Provide Culturally Sensitive and Inclusive Care</h3>
                <p>We respect the diverse identities, cultures, faith traditions, and backgrounds of all individuals. Every client receives care tailored to who they are and where they come from.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="spiritual-detail">
            <h2>Spiritual Integrative Option</h2>
            <p>At Selah Therapeutic Services Limited, we recognize the profound role that spirituality can play in healing, resilience, and meaning-making. While not required, clients who value spiritual or faith-based perspectives may choose to integrate these themes into therapy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A gentle, client-led approach where psychological and spiritual perspectives work together to support healing.</li>
                <li>Your beliefs guide the process — not mine.</li>
                <li>This option is offered only when you request it, and always with cultural humility and clinical sensitivity.</li>
